# DV-Practica5

This practice is a full experience with no menu. It mainly allows us to interact with basic text and UI elements from code and develop programing techniques like singletons and object pools.

Fight for the highest score, there are 3 bad targets and 3 good targets. A bad target gives 100 points but on not hitting it on time looses you 100 and 10 health. A good guy looses you 200 on hit. It ends after 60 seconds or loosing all health.
